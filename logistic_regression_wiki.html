<h4>Definition <br></h4>
<p></p>
<p>
    Logistic regression is a statistical model for studying the relationships between a set of qualitative variables Xi and a qualitative variable Y. It’s a generalized linear model using a logistic function as a function.</p>

<p>A logistic regression model can also predict the probability of an event happening (value of 1) or not (value of 0) from the optimization of the regression coefficients. This result always varies between 0 and 1. When the predicted value is greater than
    a threshold, the event is likely to occur, while when this value is below the same threshold, it isn't [1].</p>

        However, this method can be adapted to other cases and in particular that of predicting the number of deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 or, more commonly, COVID-19. The aim will be to find out how many deaths can we expect in this pandemic [2].</p>

            You will be able to "have fun" by changing the name of the country as well as the t0 (which I recall, is determined empirically) as soon as the logistic curve is superimposed on the curve of real cases (as in the <b>Figure 1</b> below).</p>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>

        This is an example of a machine learning logistic regression application that wasn't chosen by chance. In the current conditions that impact us all, it’s important to realize that if we want to get out of this pandemic, we absolutely have to respect the
        rules put in place by the government. The number of deaths from COVID-19 is steadily increasing. The predictions were far above the real cases. This means that the measures taken are appropriate, but they still have to be respected. <b>We are all concerned, we are all responsible.</b></p><br></div>
